Pure Media Server is an Open Source project to manage visuals and audio in stage, perfomances, installations, events,,...,  

The control input is through Open Lighting Arquitecture, so we can use any open lighting protocolo (ArtNet, PathPort, ShowNet, ACN, SandNet,...) or DMX-USB device (Enttec USB DMX Pro, Velleman, Anyuma,..). 

The graphic and audio engine are two Pure Data process running in the background. You will need a graphics card OpenGL capable and the driver for it 
correctly installed.

I'm developing and testing in Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu precise 12.04. It should compile and work in anothers Debian based distros.

Features:

- 8 video, pictures or text layers.
- 8 audio layers.
- Advanced playback (normal, back, ping.pong, entry point, exit point, speed, loop).
- Each layer can be mapped onto a surface with 4 point of Bèzier.
- A lot of formats: avi, mov, mpg, HD,... 
- Some video effects.
- Position, Rotation, Size.
- Croma/Luma mask.
- Text through a text file, with 255 phrases.
