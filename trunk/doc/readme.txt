Pure Media Server is a project to manage visuals and audio in stage, perfoms, installations, events,,..., but Open Source. 

The control input is through Open Lighting Arquitecture, so we can use any lighting protocolo or DMX-USB device. 

The graphic motor is Pure Data with Gem running in the background. 

I'm developing and testing in Debian Wheezy. All the binaries are compiled for Wheezy. It should compile and work in anothers Linux distros and MacOs X too. Open Lighting Arquitecture not compiles in Windows, so it's not posible use PMS in that platform.

Features:

- 8 video, pictures or text layers
- Advanced playback (normal, back, ping.pong, entry point, exit point, speed, loop)
- Each layer can be mapped onto a surface with 4 point of Bèzier.
- A lot of formats: avi, mov, mpg, HD,... 
- Some Effects
- Position, Rotation, Size.
- Croma/Luma mask.
- Text through a text file, with 255 phrases. 

I'm working in the translation to english, but i prefer coding!

At the moment only in spanish:

Para instalar PMS vea instalacion.txt
 
Para usar PMS vea manual.txt
